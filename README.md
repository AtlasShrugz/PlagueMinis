Hi, Professor Wang! I sort of got GitHub figured out. I'm still struggling a bit, as you can tell, but I was at least able to get it uploaded!
For this being my first ever website from scratch that I was allowed to personalize by myself, without restraining instructions, I am proud of it. 
I was trying to get the top bar to spread across the full page, and I know how to do it, but the "width 100%" kept breaking my damn page for some reason, so I gave up on that hope.
Regardless, with this update, I added a link back to the home/index page, all you have to do is click on the Image of Brain, and he'll take you back. I also added a little bit to the community tab,
as well as cleaned some stuff up.

 Thanks for your patience, best regards, Avery.
